butWhyMod?

But why modals? Attempts to remove modals for the webpage. Allows for whitelist/ignore list of hosts that you don't want to disable modals on. Also allows for custom domain and patterns list. Also can turn off automatic removal and disable modals on a per-page basis (set to off by default as per web browser security policy). *Please be aware that some websites requires modals to work properly and not all modals are bad. Please configure to apply on the pages that you truly want this on.*
