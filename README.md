butWhyMod?

But why modals? Attempts to remove modals for the webpage. Allows for whitelist/ignore list of hosts that you don't want to disable modals on. Also allows for custom domain and patterns list. Also can turn off automatic removal and disable modals on a per-page basis. Please be aware that some websites requires modals to work properly and not all modals are bad. Please configure to apply on the pages that you truly want this on.

There seems to be a bug with the packaged version of the plugin where it won't work on file:/// url's but it works on the unpacked version. This problem doesn't exist in the firefox version and shouldn't be a problem.
