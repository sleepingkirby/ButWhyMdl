butWhyMod?

But why modals? Attempts to remove modals for the webpage. Allows for whitelist/ignore list of hosts that you don't want to disable modals on. Also allows for custom domain and patterns list. Also can turn off automatic removal and disable modals on a per-page basis. Please be aware that some websites requires modals to work properly and not all modals are bad. Please configure to apply on the pages that you truly want this on.

For the google chrome version, since I don't want to force people to pay for my plugin nor do I want to pay 5 dollars to register for the store, here are the instructions for installing the plugin. Go:
https://github.com/sleepingkirby/butWhyMod/tree/chrome

and download the .crx file.

open the extensons page on google chrome:
chrome://extensions/

drag and drop the .crx file into that window.
